Vector Addition: C = 1/A + 1/B
To enter the seed for the initialization of RNG ? (1/0) 1
Enter the seed: 12345
To test rand / rand_16870 ? (1/0) 1
Testing rand ...
RAND_MAX = 2147483647
x = 383100999
y = 858300821
To check whether the algorithm of rand() is x(i+1) = 16807*x(i) mod (2^31 -1)
z = 622516487, z != y, the algorithm of rand is different from above !
y = 383100999
The period of rand() is 123349810.000000
