#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Please fix the following settings (DO NOT CHANGE THEM).
#
#	- Universe:      The running environment of Condor.
#	- Executable:    This job start up script.
#	- Machine_count: This cluster only provide environment for jobs
#                        running in a single node. So please set it to 1.
#
Universe      = vanilla
Executable    = /opt/bin/runjob
Machine_count = 1

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	The output files:
#
#	- Output: The STDOUT of this job.
#	- Error:  The STDERR of this job.
#	- Log:    The log message from Condor.
#
Output        = condor.out
Error         = condor.err
Log           = condor.log

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	The Queue.
#
#
#Requirements  = (MTYPE == "TEST")
Requirements  = (MTYPE == "sm61_60G")

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	The number of GPUs required. Since each computing node has 2 GPUs,
#	one should set it to either 1 or 2.
#
Request_cpus  = 1

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#       Change this parameter to the full path of your working directory
#
Initialdir    = /work/cuda_lecture/Ising2D

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Please modify the following line according to your code. The
#	syntax is:
#
#	Arguments = <executable_name> [<input_file>] [<output_file>]
#
#	where [<input_file>] and [<output_file>] are optional. You can
#	choose either one of the three settings.
#
#	(Suppose that the code or script to run the computation is named
#	 "jexec". ./jexec means that the code is located in your working
#	 directory. If it is located elsewhere, please provide its full path)
#
#	Arguments = ./jexec
#	    (running your code "jexec" directly without any arguments)
#
#	Arguments = ./jexec inp.txt
#	    (this is equivalent to "./jexec < inp.txt")
#
#	Arguments = ./jexec inp.txt out.txt
#	    (this is equivalent to "./jexec < inp.txt >> out.txt")
#
#
#	The GPU ID can be queried by either of the following ways.
#
#	- From the environment variable $GPU_ID.
#
#	- From the file "GID" created in the working directory.
#
#	- If the <input_file> is provided, the place to fill in the GPU ID
#	  in the <input_file> should be the keyword "GPU_ID".
#
Arguments = ./ising2d_1gpu_gmem_v3 input_1gpu output_1gpu_v3
#Arguments = ./deviceQuery 
#Arguments = ./deviceQuery /dev/null deviceQuery.out 
#Arguments = ./p2pBandwidthLatencyTest /dev/null p2pBandwidthTest.out 

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	If you want to receive a notification when your job starts or
#	is completed, please provide your Email address here. Otherwise
#	please set it to "never".
#
Notification = never

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	End of the settings. Please do not edit the followings.
