There are 3 exceution files:

  laplace_cpu: CPU only, which can be run on the console.
  laplace: GPU without using texture, with optional CPU solution.
  laplaceTex: GPU using texure, with optional CPU solution.

Some data of test runs:

/data_64       (64 x 64) 
/data_64_Tex   (64 x 64, GPU using texture)

/data_128      (128 x 128) 
/data_128_Tex  (128 x 128, GPU using texture)

/data_256      (256 x 256) 
/data_256_Tex  (256 x 256, GPU using texture)

/data_512      (512 x 512) 
/data_512_Tex  (512 x 512, GPU using texture)

/data_1024      (1024 x 1024) 
/data_1024_Tex  (1024 x 1024, GPU using texture)

When the lattice size reaches 128 x 128
the advantage of using GPU becomes obvious. 

When the lattice size is very large,say 2048 x 2048  
the advantage of using texture becomes obvious. 

In doing test runs, you should only compute the CPU solution
once for each lattice size, since it takes a very long time
for CPU to compute for a large lattice, say, 512 x 512 and beyond.
To turn off the CPU solution, the last line of the input file 
should be entered as the following example.

For laplace.cu, the input file looks like

GPU_ID
512 512
16 16 
1

where the last line only selects the GPU solution.


For laplaceTex.cu (using texture), the input file looks like

GPU_ID
512 512
16 16
0

where the last line only selects the GPU solution.
